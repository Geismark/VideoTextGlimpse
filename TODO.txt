ffmpeg currently downloads as .webm
- is this consistent
- can it be forced to save as mp4 (or similar) instead?
write tests
write custom logger
currently, each section of the same video requires its own download - looking online, seems this is the only way? Definitely worth looking into

reverse existing file search
- check for image, THEN check for video

make project more efficient (suspect cropping, specifically excluding images due to already existing, could be significantly improved)
